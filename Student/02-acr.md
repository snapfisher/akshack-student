# Challenge 2: The Azure Container Registry

[< Previous Challenge](./01-containers.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./03-k8sintro.md)

## Introduction

Now that we have our application packaged as container images, where do they go?

## Description

In this challenge we will be creating and setting up a new, private, Azure Container Registry. This will be the new home of the containers we just created. We will see later on how Kubernetes will pull our images from this registry.

- Deploy an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Ensure your ACR has proper permissions and credentials set up
- Login to your ACR
- Push your Docker container images to the ACR
  - If you don't have the images locally, you can IMPORT them into ACR via a command like `az acr import -n MyRegistry --source docker.io/whatthehackmsft/content-api:v1 -t
        content-api:v1` and `az acr import -n MyRegistry --source docker.io/whatthehackmsft/content-web:v1 -t
        content-web:v1`
- List all images in your ACR

## Success Criteria

1. You have provisioned a new Azure Container Registry
1. You have deployed your container images to the registry.
2. You can log into the registry and see all images.
3. Extra Credit: (optional) Use [ACR Tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-quickstart-task-cli) to build your container images in the cloud
